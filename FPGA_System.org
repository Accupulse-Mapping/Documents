* Purpose
Initial Functional specification This document will contain a mixture
of technical requirements and specifications at the outset. The next
revision of the documents will separate requirements and
specifications.
* Scope
Initial Definition Initial FPGA/DSP Architecture Accupulse System
Define requirements for FPGA boards to do initial development and
prototype.
* Intended Audience
Accupulse technical personnel
* Archiectural Requirements
The FPGA system will consist of a multiple of FPGA SOC system boards
with a PCIe 3 interface to a host Windows PC system. System functions
will be shared acroos boards in that every board shall have the same
functionality the only differnce being that of channel number. This
will simplify the system and its maintentance in the long run by
avioding multiple builds for multiple FPGA boards. Initial development
may use multiple boards to develop different system functionality to
allow the parallelsation of tasks; i.e. DSP development done on one
board while host S/W development is done on another.

* Overview

* Motivations and Constraints
+	Purchase off the shelf (COTS) boards for rapid prototype
+	Use vendors and technology with already
+	Established engineering and technical support resources
+	Use FPGAs made in Intel Fabs in the USA - no Allocation
+	Use FPGAs that can be converted in to Structured ASIC
* Features
+	QSPF+ Optical Interface to the PIU for patient isolation
+	PCIe 3 interface to the Host
+	2X Serial SATA rev 3 @ 6Gb/s
+	3X USB 2.0
+	1X USB 3.0 OTG Type A
+	SPI, 2C UART, 8 GPIOs
* Implementation Details
** Channels per FPGA SOC
This has yet to be determined. Initial assumption is 64 per board
| Inputs | B/W | Word |   |  Total |
|--------+-----+------+---+--------|
|     64 | 1e6 |   24 |   | 1.54e9 |
#+TBLFM: @2$5=$1*$2*$3;e3
The input B/W for the FPGA board can be up to 40Gb/s
** Localization Data Filters
I/Q demodulation and low pass filter at ADC sample rate
** EGM/ECG Data Filters
FIR LPF and decimation to display storage sample rate (2400Hz)
** Self Test Signal Generation
+ Capability to generate test signals for self test.
+ Generate LOC signals
** Host I/F
16X XCVR 8G channels
** NDI I/F
FPGA UART
** Test Modes
*** Source signal Tesst
*** Loop Back Test

*** ADC Test mode
*** I/Q Test
*** EGM/ECG Test
*** Test signal generation
Use this to hest Host S/W in GUI
+ Other signals?
+ EGM Test signals
+ Magnetic Test signals
+ Impedance Test signals
** PIU Control
*** PIU Configuration
** PIU Status
*** ADC Health
** FPGA Status
*** FPGA Fabric
*** FPGA Processor
*** FPGA processor to HOST COMM status
*** Input and Output FIFO status
** Diagnostic I/F
Should this be UART or USB.
** Raw Data
Enable the display and processiing of a limited number of channels of
raw data for system debug.
* Issues
** Time synchronzation
+	Magnetic and Impedance synchronization
+	Time stamp sync with host time
** Magnet and Impedance Reference 
+	Create same phyisical reference location
** PIU
+	Need Way to combine all digital streams for optical link.
