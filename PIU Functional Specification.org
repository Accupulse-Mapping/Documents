* Purpose
Initial Functional specification. This document will contain a mixture
of technical requirements and specifications at the outset. The next
revision of the documents will separate requirements and
specifications. This is the functional specification for the Patient
Interface Unit (PIU)
* Scope
+ Initial Functional Specification of the PIU including the Front
  Panel Interface (FPI).
+ Define Functions in terms of Initial Users requirements.
* Intended Audience
+ Accupulse technical personnel
+ External Accupulse Consultants

* Overview

* Motivations and Constraints
+	Patient Isolation via optical fiber comm
+	All-in-one Patient interface: record, EP map, pace
* Features
+	QSPF+ Optical Interface to the SoC for patient isolation
+	128 Intracardic Channels
+	Pacing Channels (inputs/outputs)
+	Isolated Power supply (internal/External)
+	Power on self test (POST)
+	Debug Interface via USB
+       View raw channel data of USB
+       Debug and verify independent of SoC system.
* Implementation Details
** SoC Interface
+ This has yet to be determined. Initial assumption is 64 chs per SoC.
+ QSPF can handle up to 40Gb/s
+ Assume connections for 4 QSFPs to 4 SoC systems
+ Need to Choose FPGA to encode data streams
| Outputs | B/W | Word |   |  Total |

#+TBLFM: @2$5=$1*$2*$3;e3
The input B/W for the FPGA board can be up to 40Gb/s
** Localization Data Filters
I/Q demodulation here or in FPGA?
** EGM/ECG Data Filters
Anti-alias filters for ADCs
** U/S Receive
Implement U/S receive system in first generation?
** Signal Generation
+ Capability to generate test signals for self test?
+ Generate LOC signals VIA DDS?
+ Generate U/S signals in Gen 1?
** Test Modes
*** Source signal Test
*** Loop Back Test
*** ADC Test mode
*** I/Q Test
*** EGM/ECG Test
*** Test signal generation
Use this to test Host S/W in GUI
+ Other signals?
+ EGM/ECG Test signals
+ Magnetic Test signals
+ Impedance Test signals
** PIU Control
Allow PIU control and configuration over USB to allow for test and
debug independent of SoC/Host system
*** PIU Configuration
**** Pacing Switch
** PIU Status
*** ADC Health
** FPGA Status
*** SoC Interface check
*** Input and Output FIFO status
** Diagnostic I/F
Should this be UART or USB or ?
** Raw Data
Configure for Raw data output via USB for testing without SoC system.
* Issues
** POST Extent
To what extent to we want to have the PIU testable without the SoC
system?
** Pacing Implementation
+ Understand Requirements Better
+ Design in Architecture
+ Include switching in first revision?
